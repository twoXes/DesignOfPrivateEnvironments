# Second Treatise on Government 

> **Political power** then, I take to be a right of making laws with penalties of death, and consquently all less penalties, for the regulating and preserving of property, and of employing the force of the community, in the execution of such laws, and in the defence of the common-wealth from foreign injury; and all this only for the public good. (p. 8) 

> what state all men are naturally in...**a state of perfect freedom** to order their actions, and dispose of their possessions and persons, as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature, without asking leave, or depending upon the will of any other man. (p.8)
