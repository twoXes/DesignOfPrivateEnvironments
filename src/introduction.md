Abstract
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Environments that can be encrypted at-rest, in-transit, and in-use, available for use by a general public are the result of a war of ideas that have spanned a millenia. 
The freedom to self-governence in private and presented for public inspection is built upon various principles generated by Locke, Kant, Foucault and a host of other critical thinkers. 
Though self-governenace is and will be under perpetual/unending attack, it is the right to self-governence for all individuals that allows any anonymous identity the freedom to public key encryption at all stages of data/workload.
